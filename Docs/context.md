Overview
The SaaS platform allows users to upload documents (PDFs and text files) and generates questions based on their content using LLM (Large Language Model) integration. It supports various question types (e.g., multiple-choice, short answer) and integrates advanced features like semantic search, web search augmentation, and (optionally) a knowledge graph for complex queries. The system is designed with scalability in mind using microservices, containerization, and cloud services.

Document Upload and Parsing
Technologies:
Backend Frameworks: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
database: Postgres, Neo4j

PDF Parsing: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six

Text Extraction: NLTK, spaCy

Implementation Steps:
API Endpoint for File Uploads:

Create an endpoint to handle file uploads.

Accept PDF and plain text files.

Parsing Logic:

Use PDF parsing libraries to extract text from PDF files.

Use text extraction libraries to process and clean the extracted text.

Temporary Storage:

Store the extracted text in-memory or in a temporary file system for subsequent processing.

Error Handling:

Validate file types and handle parsing errors gracefully.

Basic LLM Integration
Technologies:
Integration Frameworks: Langchain or LlamaIndex

LLM Providers: OpenAI API (or other LLM providers)

Implementation Steps:
Setup Integration:

Configure Langchain or LlamaIndex to interface with the LLM API.

Text Chunking:

Chunk the extracted text into manageable segments to meet the LLM's input requirements.

Prompt Creation:

Develop a basic prompt (e.g., "Generate 5 questions based on this text.") to trigger the question generation process.

Display Output:

Process and display the generated questions to the user.

User Interface (UI)
Technologies:
Frontend Frameworks: React, Vue.js, or simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Implementation Steps:
File Upload Interface:

Design a clean UI for users to upload documents.

Question Display:

Implement a section to display generated questions.

Client-side Logic:

Use JavaScript (or a framework’s mechanisms) to send files to the backend API and handle responses.

Question Type Selection
Technologies:
Frontend: HTML forms, dropdown menus

Backend: Conditional logic based on input

Implementation Steps:
UI Dropdown:

Add a dropdown menu to allow users to select the type of question (e.g., multiple-choice, short answer).

Backend Logic:

Use conditional statements to modify the LLM prompt based on the selected question type.

Dynamic Generation:

Ensure the system adjusts question generation logic accordingly.

Vector Database Integration
Technologies:
Vector Databases: Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB

Embedding Models: OpenAI Embeddings, Sentence Transformers

Implementation Steps:
Embedding Generation:

Generate embeddings for document chunks using an embedding model.

Storing Embeddings:

Store embeddings in the vector database for semantic search.

Semantic Search:

Implement a search mechanism to retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.

Integration:

Integrate the search results into the question generation process to enhance relevance.

Web Search Integration
Technologies:
Web Search APIs: Google Custom Search API, Bing Search API

Scraping Libraries: Beautiful Soup, Scrapy

Implementation Steps:
Search Agent Creation:

Develop a web search agent using Langchain or LlamaIndex.

Query Generation:

Use the LLM to generate search queries from document content.

Result Extraction:

Extract relevant information from the web search results.

Embedding Storage:

Store embeddings of the search results in the vector database for integration with document content.

AI Agents for Question Types
Technologies:
Agent Framework: Langchain agents, custom Python functions

Implementation Steps:
Agent Development:

Create specialized agents for each question type (e.g., multiple-choice, essay).

Dataset Fine-Tuning:

Fine-tune agents using datasets specific to each question type.

Utilizing Resources:

Ensure agents can access both the vector database and the LLM to generate precise questions.

Complexity Handling:

Allow agents to produce questions that cover varying levels of complexity.

Knowledge Graph Implementation (Optional)
Technologies:
Graph Databases: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

Ontology Tools: Protégé

Implementation Steps:
Ontology Design:

Define an ontology for the specific domain of interest.

Entity Extraction:

Extract entities and relationships from both document content and web search results.

Graph Storage:

Store the extracted relationships in a graph database.

Enhanced Question Generation:

Utilize the knowledge graph to generate questions that test connections and relationships in the data.

Scalable Architecture
Technologies:
Containerization: Docker

Orchestration: Kubernetes

Cloud Services: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure

Implementation Steps:
Microservices Architecture:

Decompose the application into independent services (e.g., API, LLM integration, AI agents).

Containerization:

Package each microservice using Docker for consistency and portability.

Orchestration:

Deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster to automate scaling and ensure resilience.

Cloud Infrastructure:

Leverage cloud services for storage (e.g., S3), databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB), and messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

Load Balancing & Caching:

Use a load balancer to distribute traffic and implement caching to reduce database load.

Asynchronous Processing:

Use message queues for handling tasks such as document processing and web search asynchronously.

API Design and Documentation
Technologies:
API Documentation Tools: OpenAPI (Swagger)

Implementation Steps:
API Specification:

Design a comprehensive and well-defined API for all functionalities (file upload, parsing, question generation, etc.).

Documentation Generation:

Use Swagger to auto-generate and maintain up-to-date API documentation.

Versioning:

Implement API versioning for backward compatibility as new features are introduced.

User Authentication and Authorization
Technologies:
Authentication Protocols: OAuth 2.0, JWT

Implementation Steps:
Secure Login:

Implement secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 or JWT.

Access Control:

Enforce authorization policies to control user access to various endpoints.

Session Management:

Ensure sessions are managed securely and user data is protected.

Monitoring and Logging
Technologies:
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

Logging: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Implementation Steps:
Performance Monitoring:

Implement monitoring tools to track system performance and resource utilization.

Centralized Logging:

Use a logging stack to centralize logs, making it easier to debug and trace issues.

Alerting:

Set up alerts to notify administrators of performance degradation or failures.

Feedback Loop
Technologies:
Database Integration: Relational or NoSQL database

API Endpoints: RESTful endpoints

Implementation Steps:
Rating System:

Create a feature that allows users to rate the quality of generated questions.

Data Storage:

Store user feedback in a dedicated database table or collection.

Continuous Improvement:

Analyze feedback periodically to improve the LLM prompts and AI agents over time.
